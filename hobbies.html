<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I really enjoy learning new things and have recently taught myself how to crochet. <br/>
        This summer I will be taking a bladesmithing class and have been taking Korean <br/>
        lessons for about a year. When I am at home, I enjoy doing puzzles, building legos, <br/>
        reading, watching shows, playing games. A subject I enjoy learning about is geography and <br/>
        I challenged myself to memorize the world map.
